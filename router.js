     * This implementation finds route from [_source] to [_target] with the
     * least number of hops over the relays.
     *
     * Returns [null] if no path found, else return the path as a list of
     * names, starting with that of [_source] and ending with that of
     * [_target], and a potentially empty list of names from the relays.
     *
     * All of [_source], [_target], and each relay must have a visible()
     * method that tests the commutative reachability between the method
     * target and its argument.
     *
     * Similarly, all of the above must have a distance() method that computes
     * the distance between the receiver and the method argument.
     *
     * The algorithm works in two phases:
     *  1. first moving forward from [_source] toward [_target] over the
     *     relays in steps and recording the ones reachable from the relays
     *     found in the last step,
     *  2. then moving backward from [_target] toward [_source] over the
     *     possible routes found and selecting the one with the shortest
     *     distance at each hop.
     *
     * Phase 1: the possible routes are explored using the following
     * algorithm:
     *  1. Set [frontier] to be a list with [_source] as its only element.
     *  2. Set [outskirts] to be the relays.
     *  3. If [frontier] is not empty, repeat:
     *     a. Find all elements in [frontier] that can directly reach
     *        [_target].
     *     b. Add each hit to the list of nodes that can directly reach
     *        [_target].
     *     c. If any such element is found, skip to Phase 2.
     *     d. Find all satellites in [outskirts] that are reachable from any
     *        element in [frontier].
     *     e. Add each hit to the list of nodes that can directly reach that
     *        element.
     *     f. Set [frontier] to the list of satellites thus found.
     *     g. Remove [frontier] from [outskirts].
     *     h. Go to step 3.
     *  4. Conclude that there is no viable route.
     *
     * Phase 2: compute a route by the following algorithm:
     *  1. Set [node] to be [_target].
     *  2. Set [path] to be a list with [node] as its only element.
     *  3. If [node] has elements added in step 3.b or 3.e in the Phase 1,
     *     repeat:
     *     a. Compute the distance from [node] to all elements added to that
     *        node.
     *     b. Find the shortest distance among them.
     *     c. Select the element with the shortest distance thereto.
     *     d. Set [node] to that element.
     *     e. Add [node] to the beginning of [path].
