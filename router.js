/*
 * This function finds the shortest route from [details.source] to [details.target]
 * with the least number of hops over [details.satellites].
 *
 * The algorithm works in two phases:
 *  1. finding the possible routes from [details.source] forward over [details.satellites]
 *     toward [details.target], and then
 *  2. moving backward from [details.target] toward [details.source] over the possible
 *     routes and selecting the one with the shortest physical distance.
 *
 * The possible routes are explored using the following algorithm:
 *  1. Set [frontier] to be [details.source].
 *  2. Set [outskirts] to be [details.satellites].
 *  3. Repeat the following steps:
 *     1. Find all elements in [frontier] that can reach [details.target].
 *     2. Add each hit to the list of positions that can directly reach [details.target].
 *     3. If any such element is found, go to second phase of the full algorithm.
 *     4. Find all satellites in [outskirts] that are reachable from any
 *        element in [frontier].
 *     4. Add each hit to the list of positions that can directly reach that element.
 *     5. Set [frontier] to the list of satellites thus found.
 *     6. Remove [frontier] from [outskirts].
 *     7. If [frontier] is not empty, go to step 3.
 *
 * If [details.target] has not been reached, conclude that there is no viable route.
 *
 * If [details.target] has been reached, compute the shortest route by the following
 * algorithm:
 *  1. Set [node] to be [details.target].
 *  2. Set [path] to be a list with [node] as its only element.
 *  3. If [node] has elements added in step 3.2 or 3.4 in the first phase, repeat
 *     the following steps:
 *     1. Compute the distance from [node] to all elements found.
 *     2. Find the smallest distance among them.
 *     3. Select the element with the shortest distance thereto.
 *     4. Set [node] to that element.
 *     5. Add [node] to the beginning of [path].
