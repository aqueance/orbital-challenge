/*
 * This function finds the shortest route from [_source] to [_target]
 * with the least number of hops over [_relays].
 *
 * Returns [null] if no path found, else return the path as a list of names,
 * starting with that of [_source] and ending with that of [_target], and a
 * potentially empty list of names from [_relays].
 *
 * All of [_source], [_target], and each element of [_relays] have a visible()
 * method that tests the commutative reachability between the method target
 * and its argument.
 *
 * Similarly, all of the above must have a connect() method to record the fact
 * that the method target and the method argument are directly reachable from
 * one another.
 *
 * The algorithm works in two phases:
 *  1. first moving forward from [_source] toward [_target] over [_relays]
 *     in steps and recording the ones reachable from the relays found in the
 *     last step,
 *  2. the moving backward from [_target] toward [_source] over the possible
 *     routes found and selecting the one with the shortest distance at each
 *     hop.
 *
 * Phase 1: the possible routes are explored using the following algorithm:
 *  1. Set [frontier] to be a list with [_source] as its only element.
 *  2. Set [outskirts] to be [_relays].
 *  3. If [frontier] is not empty, repeat:
 *     a. Find all elements in [frontier] that can directly reach [_target].
 *     b. Add each hit to the list of nodes that can directly reach [_target].
 *     c. If any such element is found, skip to Phase 2.
 *     d. Find all satellites in [outskirts] that are reachable from any
 *        element in [frontier].
 *     e. Add each hit to the list of nodes that can directly reach that
 *        element.
 *     f. Set [frontier] to the list of satellites thus found.
 *     g. Remove [frontier] from [outskirts].
 *     h. Go to step 3.
 *  4. Conclude that there is no viable route.
 *
 * Phase 2: compute a route by the following algorithm:
 *  1. Set [node] to be [_target].
 *  2. Set [path] to be a list with [node] as its only element.
 *  3. If [node] has elements added in step 3.b or 3.e in the Phase 1,
 *     repeat:
 *     a. Compute the distance from [node] to all elements added to that node.
 *     b. Find the shortest distance among them.
 *     c. Select the element with the shortest distance thereto.
 *     d. Set [node] to that element.
 *     e. Add [node] to the beginning of [path].
